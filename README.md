# Post-Code Bootcamp School

After graduating from a coding bootcamp in December 2019, I realized that this there is so much more to learn in the world of software and everything I learned the past months prior is just the very basics of information needed to actually have a successful career.

## Study Tips

I tried all sorts of study techniques through my undergraduate days and as I was going through bootcamp to learn to code. After scouring the internet one day for study tips and tricks, I came across two very important techniques to learning a skill that I feel are valuable to not just programmers but anyone. 

- [Active Recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall) - This is the notion of efficient learning proven by studies that says all we need to learn is to stimulate memory during out learning process. I always wondered how people got into medical school with the vast amount of knowledge that they need to learn and this is one of the tricks they use to achieve that goal. One of my favorite youtubers is a Cambridge University medical student has a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukLnPbIffxE&t=1072s) on active recall and I recommend you guys check him out!
- The other technique is [Space Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) which uses a space time period between learning concepts in order to increase the learning and memorization. I use this a lot with conceptual information like remembering which data structures does what, their time/space complexities, etc.

## Technologies

This section will be  the technologies that I will be planning to use and learn as I'm studying mostly data structures and algos for the next couple of months. I believe some interviews will ask you to build something (not sure for juniors) so being able to build simple CRUD applications and practicing daily is crucial for success.

## Topics

I made an outline of things I need to go over while and during the interview applying process, this is just a outline and as I go through each topic, I will be updating with helpful links/resources that will help.
