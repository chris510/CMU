- What is Memory?
    - Bounded canvas of memory slots that live somewhere in the computer that can store data.
    - Bounded = limited amount of data to be stored and run out of memory; why space complexity is important
- What is the format memory is stored?
    - Base 2 format as bits
- How does a program store memory slots?
- What are back to back memory spots?
    - Memory slots that are right next to each other
- What is the unit used for memory?
    - Bits (Zeros and One's)
- What does one memory slot hold?
    - 8 Bits or 1 byte
- How do we store information into slots if memory are zero and ones
    - We can convert information into binary numbers
- What is a binary number?
- What is positional notation?
- What is endianness?

    Order of bytes when representing information in binary

- What is the access complexity of a memory slot?
    - inexpensive basic operation that is very fast!
